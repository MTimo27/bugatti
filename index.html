            innovative technology, and iconic,
            performance-oriented form make it a unique
            masterpiece of art, form and technique, that
            pushes boundaries beyond imagination.

          <h1>UNCOVERING A NEW DIMENSION: THE SKY</h1>
          <p>
            The Skyview option was developed in accordance
            with the attributes that characterize the
            CHIRON. The symbolic horseshoe grill, and the
            distinctive C-bar on the side, still define it
            as unmistakably BUGATTI, as do its pronounced
            lines and generous surfaces. From inside, the
            glass roof enables a view into another
            dimension, flooding the cockpit with natural
            light.
