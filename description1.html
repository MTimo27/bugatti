          „La Voiture Noire“ – More than a reinterpretation
        </h2>
        <p>
          “The Atlantic is one of the icons of BUGATTI’s
          rich history. At the time, this coupé was unique
          in its elegance, quality and performance, and it
          remains so today. A luxurious hyper sports car.
          For us, both an inspiration and obligation at the
          same time,” says Stephan Winkelmann, President of
          BUGATTI.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of exclusivity, performance and luxury,
          the new “La Voiture Noire” is every inch the equal
          of Jean Bugatti’s masterpiece. It is the perfect
          manifestation of BUGATTI’s cornerstones: “dynamic,
          luxury and elegance”.

      <p>
        “La Voiture Noire” is an opus of elegance and
        finesse. Purism and elegance are reflected in every
        surface and continued into each minute detail. The
        windscreen seems to flow seamlessly into the windows
        like the visor on a helmet. The newly designed
        bumpers are smoothly integrated into the body. Clear
        lines guide the eye subtly over the surface, which
        seems to blend into a single piece. With its
        extended front end and the distinctive BUGATTI
        signature line, “La Voiture Noire” creates an
        elongated impression. Its elegant waistline
        accentuates the coupé’s contours. At the rear, six
        tailpipes bear witness to the incredible power of
        “La Voiture Noire”. Subtly incorporated into the
        overall appearance, they hint at the strength of the
        car’s heart, the iconic 16-cylinder engine.

        <h2>flowing lines</h2>
        <p>
          The fin running down the center of “La Voiture
          Noire” echoes the Atlantic’s legendary dorsal
          seam. It is a unique symbiosis of history and
          modernity, which subtly runs into the flowing
          lines of the perforated rear.

          Each component has been crafted by hand,
          accentuating the level of BUGATTI’s manufacturing
          quality. The carbon fiber body has a deep black
          gloss, interrupted only by the ultrafine fiber
          structure. Perfectly harmonized materials merge
          with the finish to leave the surface gleaming
          vividly.
