        <h2>Jean Bugatti – the Stylist</h2>
        <p>
          Like his father Ettore, Gianoberto Mario Carlo
          Bugatti, named Jean, was a visionary, far ahead of
          his time. Ettore’s eldest son was a gifted car
          designer with a rare feel for proportions and
          aerodynamics. From the late 1920s onward, he
          influenced the development of the company with his
          own stylistic ideas and designs, before assuming
          responsibility for management in 1936 at the age
          of 27.

          Jean was responsible for creating numerous
          classics for the legendary brand. With his
          pioneering designs for bodies, engines and
          chassis, he created some extraordinary vehicles
          until his tragic death in an accident in 1939,
          securing his place as a visionary artist in the
          history of the automobile.

          The three remaining Atlantics are among the
          world’s most expensive and desirable classic cars.
          The whereabouts of Jean Bugatti’s personal “La
          Voiture Noire” are still unknown – the automotive
          equivalent of the Amber Room. It is thought the
          car disappeared during the Second World War, sent
          to a safe region before the German troops invaded
          Alsace. Its disappearance more than 80 years ago
          remains the biggest mystery in BUGATTI’s fabled
          history. Today, “La Voiture Noire” lives on as a
          myth.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the new “La Voiture Noire”, BUGATTI has
          created a car that takes up that legend and
          carries it forward to the present day. In its
          exclusiveness, style, quality and performance, “La
          Voiture Noire” is an unprecedented creation that
          continues Jean Bugatti’s legacy in striving for
          unprecedented elegance and technical perfection.
